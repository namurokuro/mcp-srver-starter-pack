### Step 3: Animation Showcase
```python
create_scene description="Animation showcase: Animate cube rotating 360 degrees with linear interpolation, animate sphere scaling up and down with ease in-out interpolation, animate torus moving in Y axis. Set frame range 1-120, create smooth keyframe animations." field="animation"
```

### Step 4: Motion Graphics Showcase
```python
create_scene description="Motion graphics showcase: Create animated text 'AI AGENTS' that scales from 0 to 1 and rotates 360 degrees, create second text 'LEARNING & CREATING' that fades in later. Use gold emissive material, center alignment, professional typography." field="motiongraphics"
```

### Step 5: Camera Movements Showcase
```python
create_scene description="Camera movements showcase: Create cinematic camera movement - dolly forward from distance, orbit around scene, pull back and up. Use bezier interpolation with auto handles for smooth motion. Multiple camera positions showing different angles." field="cameraoperator"
```

### Step 6: Director Agent Showcase
```python
create_scene description="Director Agent showcase: Create creative vision for showcase, coordinate all agents (Modeling, Shading, Animation, Motion Graphics, Camera, VFX, Rendering), plan visual narrative, orchestrate scene composition, make creative decisions for cohesive result." field="director"
```

### Step 7: New Features Showcase
```python
create_scene description="New features showcase: Create particle system for knowledge visualization with 100 particles, enable EEVEE features (bloom, screen space reflections, ambient occlusion), add geometry nodes if available. Show modern Blender capabilities." field="vfx"
```

### Step 8: Complete Scene Setup
```python
create_scene description="Complete scene setup: Add world lighting with dark blue background, add sun light and area light, set up EEVEE rendering with bloom and reflections, configure output for MP4 video, optimize for showcase." field="rendering"
```
